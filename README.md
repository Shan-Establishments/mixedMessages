# Mixed Messages
This is the first project that I completed independently.
## How did I do it?
### Planning
+ The context of the game, what do I want it be be based on. 
+ The type of messages I wanted it to include.
+ How I could structure my code based on the type of game it was.
### Creating the message
The messages that are conducted in the code are randomly generated to interpret the users characteristics. This includes their favourite colour, their personality and 
their hobbies. It is a very simple game but it is a bit fun and interesting for the user to find different things about themselves.

I made sure to include the code on github, if anyone would like to see :).
